The /proc filesystem is a reflection of the kernel's data structures.

In this week's laboratory tasks you are required to do the following:

    Observe and try to interpret various points of information available in /proc about a process.
    Write and run a small C code that makes a process go to SLEEPING, RUNNING, ZOMBIE states and observe it with output of "ps" and information in /proc
    See the "maps" file in /proc related to a process.
    See the "limits" file in /proc/<pid> and change it with ulimit and observe it again
    Open a file in a C program and observe what happens to "fd" folder contents in /proc/<pid>
    Also, run "strace" on some Linux commands and see the list of system calls made.

Here are some commands that Abhijit used during the demo

while true; do grep State status ; done

while true; do ps aux | grep Z; sleep 1; done

ps -ef | grep a.out

Questions to be answered

(a) What is a Zombie process? is there a difference between an orphan and a zombie process?

(b) Does the Demo given by Abhijit always create a Zombie process?

(c) True/False? Every dead process first become a Zombie.

(d) How is a Zombie process "cleared"? (Observe first that it gets cleared)

(e) Write a C code and commands to show use of dup() using /proc?

(f) How is a Zombie process different from Zombies in movies ?

(g) Write a small code and commands, to show use of pipe() using /proc.
